# SoC_ChatGPT_from_Scratch

This repository documents my progress in the **SoC project â€“ ChatGPT from Scratch**.

---

## âœ… Progress Summary

### Week 1: Python & Data Science Basics
- Refreshed core Python concepts
- Covered Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data handling and visualization
- Briefly explored Plotly for interactive plots

---

### Week 2 & 3: Neural Networks
- Studied neural networks from scratch using the [StatQuest YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)
  - Covered key topics: perceptrons, activation functions, loss functions, and forward pass
  - Watched and understood videos 74 to 84, which explain these concepts in a very intuitive and visual way

---

### Week 4: Backpropagation
- Continued with the StatQuest playlist (videos 86 to 91)
  - Learned about the concept and math behind backpropagation
  - Understood gradient descent and how weights are updated during training

---

### Week 5: Introduction to PyTorch (Current Week)
- Began working with PyTorch
  - Watched [Intro to PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIenNRt2bjg)
  - Practiced creating and manipulating tensors
  - Started experimenting with building simple neural networks using `torch.nn`
